## Inspiration
Budgeting is now getting more important for students to prepare for manage their property or assets in the future, so we are now building a user-friendly budgeting app for students to manage their spending with ease.

## What it does
This budgeting app allows users to edit, add, and delete the history of transactions, which includes their expenses, income, and savings. Moreover, the app allows users to set limits to their budget, hence their awareness of budgeting could be risen. With the aid of an algorithm, an overall score will be give to users as their final tips for budgeting, which is analysed by the monthly expenses and income.
